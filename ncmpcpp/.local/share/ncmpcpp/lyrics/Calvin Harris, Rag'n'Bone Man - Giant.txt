I understood loneliness
Before I knew what it was
Saw the pills on your table
For your unrequited love
Oh, I would be nothing
Without you holding me up
Now I'm strong enough for both of us
Both of us, both of us, both of us

I am a giant (Ooh)
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant (Ooh)
We'll be breaking boulders, underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
I am a giant (Oh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
I am a giant (Oh)

Don't hide your emotion
You can throw down your guard
And freed from the notion
We can be who we are
Oh, you taught me something, yeah
That freedom is ours
It was you who taught me living is
Togetherness, togetherness, togetherness

I am a giant (Ooh)
Stand up on my shoulders, tell me what you see
'Cause I am a giant (Ooh)
We'll be breaking boulders, underneath our feet
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
I am a giant (Oh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
I am a giant (Oh)

(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
Gonna shake, throw it away, in the dirt, under me, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
Gonna shake, throw it away, in the dirt, under me, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
Gonna shake, throw it away, in the dirt, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
Gonna shake, throw it away, in the dirt, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, hey-oh)
Gonna shake, throw it away, in the dirt, yeah, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh)
Gonna shake, throw it away, in the dirt, yeah

(Ooh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am (Ooh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Ooh)
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am a giant (Ooh)
