Tryin' to free my mind

Baby
I've been travelin' on my own
Tryin' to free my mind
Tryin' to free my soul
Lately
I wonder how it feels
Am I waitin' for somethin'?
Am I waitin' for someone, now?

Am I waitin' for somethin'?
Am I waitin' for someone, now?
(Tryin' to free my mind)

I've seen saints, and they don't lie
And I feel time just pass me by
So tell me, now, I need to know
Am I waiting for a go?

(Tryin' to free my mind)
Am I waitin' for somethin'?
Am I waitin' for someone, now?

Baby
I've been travelin' on my own
Tryin' to free my mind
Tryin' to free my soul
Lately
I wonder how it feels
Am I waitin' for somethin'?
Am I waitin' for someone, now?

Tryin' to free my mind
Tryin' to free my soul
