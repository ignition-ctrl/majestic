Why do I feel like I'm drowning
Like I'm running out of air? Ah
Why do I feel like I'm falling
When I'm nowhere near the edge? Ah

Just let me know
Can you be the one to hold and not let me go?
I need to know
Could you be the one to call when I lose control?

I, I
I need your love
I need your love

I, I
I need your love
I need your love

I, I
I need your love
I need your love

I, I
Could you be one to call
When I lose control

When I lose control (I, I)
When I lose control (I, I)
When I lose control (I need your love)
When I lose control (I need your love)
When I lose control (I, I)
When I lose (I, I)
Could you be the one to call
When I lose control

I know I can be destructive
And I can change the atmosphere
All I ask from you is patience
Some patience, some patience

Just let me know
Can you be the one to hold and not let me go?
I need to know
Could you be the one to call when I lose control?

When I lose control (I, I)
When I lose control (I, I)
When I lose control (I need your love)
When I lose control (I need your love)
When I lose control (I, I)
When I lose (I, I)
Could you be the one to call
When I lose control

I, I
I need your love
I need your love

I, I
I need your love
I need your love

When I lose control (I, I)
When I lose control (I, I)
When I lose control (I need your love)
When I lose control (I need your love)
When I lose control (I, I)
When I lose (I, I)
Could you be the one to call
When I lose control
