You, you tried to play it safe
But I am planning my escape.
Yeah you want your picket fence,
but I can't even pay the rent.

I'd rather burn out then spend my life waiting.
I wanna go down, down in history.
Everybody's gonna know me when I die,
So I don't give a damn if I survive.
I'd rather burn out then spend my life waiting.

You keep it slow and steady.
I am more then good and ready.
And you set on for second place,
but I won't even run the race.

I'd rather burn out then spend my life waiting.
I wanna go down, down in history.
Everybody's gonna know me when I die,
So I don't give a damn if I survive.
I'd rather burn out then spend my life waiting.

Yeah, yeah, ooh ooh

I'd rather burn out then spend my life waiting.
I wanna go down, down in history.
Everybody's gonna know me when I die,
So I don't give a damn if I survive.
I'd rather burn out then spend my life waiting.
